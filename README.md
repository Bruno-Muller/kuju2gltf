## About this project

This project was originally designed to export MSTS/ORTS shapes (`.s` format) to **3D Train Studio** (`.gltf`), with `.ace` textures converted to `.png`. This initial implementation was hand written by the repository owner.

Support for exporting to **OpenRails** (`.gltf` with `MSFT_texture_dds` extension), with `.ace` textures converted to `.dds`, was added later with help of Artificial Intelligence.

## Examples

> kuju2gltf is a **command-line tool** (CLI).

### OpenRails
```bash
kuju2gltf "C:\path\to\shape.s" "C:\path\to\outputdir" -format orts
```

### 3D Train Studio
```bash
kuju2gltf "C:\path\to\shape.s" "C:\path\to\outputdir" -format 3dts
```

## Important note

The `.s` file must be in binary format.

If your shape is a Unicode text shape, convert it to binary first with `ffeditc_unicode.exe` (provided with MSTS).
